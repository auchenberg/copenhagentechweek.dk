intro: "For anyone interested in debates and problem Solving"
description: "The Builders of the Future event explores how we as a society can educate entrepreneurial citizens that are able to create solutions to future challenges. The event seeks to debate both how we can prepare ourselves to a labor market affected by gig-economy and automation and ask how do we navigate in a world where problems and solutions are global? How can a small country like Denmark be the builders of the future? Join the debate when UNDERBROEN teams up with IDA to find the answers."
