intro: "For anyone interested in networking, talks and problem Solving"
description: "The society of tomorrow needs to educate its citizens, to create the solutions for the problems of the future and design sustainable businesses, so these solutions can spread throughout the world. But how do we prepare our children for the future market of gig-economy and automation? How do we give them the tools to navigate in a world where problems and solutions are global? How can a small country such as Denmark become a builder of the future? Get involved in the debate, when Debatter UNDERBROEN teams up with IDA and relocates to Makerfestival the 22nd of September."
